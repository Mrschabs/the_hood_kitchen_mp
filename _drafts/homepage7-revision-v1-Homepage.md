## ‚ÄúInsanely good food, decent sized portions‚Äù

If love at first bite had a name, it would be this amazing burger. The first time I purchase burgers from THK and WOW! üëåüèæ It is safe to say, I can never look at another burger the same way again.  
Thank you so much! Myself and my kids enjoyed the burgers soooo much! Definitely \*NOT\* the last time you will see my face
